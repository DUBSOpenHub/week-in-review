## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-29

Docs-only patch release. No agent or behavior changes — just two README
tidies that landed shortly after v1.2.0.

### Changed

- **README "See it in action" section trimmed.** Removed the redundant
  "🐙 The hero shot — pulling from GitHub (no typing required)" block
  (invocation walkthrough + collapsible notes-mode example). The same
  invocation patterns are already covered in "30-second start" and
  "Use it"; the remaining sample-output block carries the demo on its
  own. Adjusted the next subhead from "Either way, you get this back"
  to "What you get back" since "either" no longer made sense.

- **Output example refreshed to match agent reality.** Audited the
  example against the live agent prompt and fixed four drift issues:
  (1) date refreshed from a months-old "Mar 17–21, 2026" to a current
  "May 25–29, 2026"; (2) Title + Labels now shown in a fenced code
  block exactly as the agent emits them (`Title: ...` /
  `Labels: weekly-update, status`) instead of dressed-up markdown bold
  and space-separated backtick code spans the agent never produces;
  (3) removed the `**Body:**` prefix label the agent doesn't emit;
  (4) closing line now mentions the Step 4 📬 "yes, file it for me"
  option so the example matches the agent's actual close.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-29

A flow-and-docs release. Same agent, same install, but the user-facing
experience is now an engaging, emoji-led four-step flow that runs
identically in the GitHub Copilot app and the Copilot CLI. The repo's
docs were realigned to match the live agent and to honestly describe
the one optional `gh issue create` write at Step 4.

### Changed

- **Agent flow rewritten as four explicit, identical-across-hosts steps.**
  The intake is now sequenced — Step 1 source 📥 (📝 notes / 🐙 GitHub /
  🎁 both), Step 2 audience 👥 (👔 manager / 🤝 team / 🪞 yourself),
  Step 3 draft 🪄, Step 4 always offer to file as a GitHub issue 📬
  (with a ready-to-run `gh issue create --body-file -` template).
  Replaces the single-combined-message intake that branched on
  `ask_user` availability. Prose-only flow now runs identically in the
  Copilot app and the CLI — no host-conditional behavior. Emojis added
  at each touchpoint to keep the experience engaging and fun. The
  hint-skip shortcut still bypasses Steps 1+2 when both source and
  audience are clear from the invocation. Verified end-to-end on a real
  GitHub-pull / manager-audience run.

- **Dropped all screenshot/file-attachment language from the agent.**
  Custom-agent attachment support is host-dependent and currently absent
  in parts of the Copilot app, so the prompt no longer mentions
  screenshots, attachments, or paperclips anywhere. Source A is now
  simply "I'll paste my notes" — paste text, GitHub URLs, brain dumps,
  anything that fits in a chat message. CLI users who want richer input
  already know how to reach for `@file` mentions or `gh` themselves.

- **Docs aligned with the new four-step flow.** README, AGENTS.md, and
  SECURITY.md all referenced the old "two-question intake delivered in
  one combined message" plus the `ask_user` tool, and SECURITY.md
  incorrectly claimed "no writes are performed." Updated to reflect
  reality: four explicit steps (source 📥 → audience 👥 → draft 🪄 →
  offer to file as issue 📬), prose-only intake (never `ask_user`) for
  cross-host consistency, and one optional `gh issue create` write at
  Step 4 — only when the user explicitly says "yes, file it" and names
  a repo. README UX examples updated to the new `A`/`B`/`C` source and
  `1`/`2`/`3` audience prompts. Continue-from-last reframed from
  fourth-source-option to conversational super-power.

- **Docs refreshed to match the verified v1.1 behavior.** Added the
  hint-skip shortcut (`@week-in-review pull from my github for my
  manager`) to the README "30-second start" + "Use it" sections,
  AGENTS.md agent description, and both install scripts'
  post-install hints. AGENTS.md overview no longer says "Copilot CLI
  agent" — works in app or CLI.

- **Body length cap relaxed for GitHub-pull mode.** Was 250 words across
  the board, which overflowed silently on busy GitHub weeks (test run
  hit ~330 words). Now: 400 words when pulling from GitHub, still 250
  when working from pasted notes. Either way, cut filler before going
  over.

### Locked-in design principles (updated for v1.2)

- **Identical experience across hosts.** Same prose-based four-step
  flow in the GitHub Copilot app and the Copilot CLI. No
  host-conditional branches in the prompt.
- **Tool-light, not tool-free.** Exactly one host tool, `gh`. Read-only
  `search` / `issue list` for the GitHub-pull and continue-from-last
  sources, plus one optional `gh issue create` write at Step 4 — only
  on explicit user "yes" + a named repo, gated by the host's standard
  tool-permission prompt. No `ask_user`, no other shell, no
  third-party APIs.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-29

A big feature-additive release. All changes are backward-compatible; the
original "paste notes, get status" flow still works exactly the same.

### Added

- **GitHub-pull source.** When chosen, the agent uses the local `gh`
  CLI to gather the last 7 days of the user's PRs, reviews, issues, and
  comments, then groups them by workstream and filters noise.
- **Continue-from-last-update source.** Finds the user's previous weekly
  issue via `gh issue list --label weekly-update --author @me`, uses its
  timestamp as the search cutoff, and skips any activity already
  reported so wins are never double-counted.
- **Audience tone presets.** Three layered tones over one shared output
  structure: *Manager* (outcomes-first, impact-quantified), *Team*
  (collaborative, handoff-friendly), *Yourself* (raw, includes small
  wins).
- **`gh` preflight + graceful fallback.** Before any GitHub work, the
  agent checks for `gh` and a valid auth state; if either is missing it
  warmly offers to switch to *Paste my own notes* mode for that run.
- **Single-turn intake parsing.** The agent parses the opening
  `@week-in-review` invocation for source/audience hints (e.g.,
  *"pull from github for my manager"*) and skips the intake entirely
  when both are clear. When it does need to ask, both questions go in
  one message — at most one Enter press before drafting starts.
- **Dual-surface positioning.** README, AGENTS, and the installers now
  call out that the agent runs identically in the GitHub Copilot app
  *and* the Copilot CLI. One install location
  (`~/.copilot/agents/`).

### Changed

- **Audience label: `boss` → `manager`** across the agent prompt,
  README, AGENTS, install scripts (19 strings across 7 files).
- **Frontmatter `description`** rewritten to reflect the new
  capabilities (notes OR GitHub activity, audience-tuned, ready for
  GitHub issue, app or CLI).

### Removed

- A Next.js + shadcn/ui landing page was prototyped during this
  release cycle and removed before tagging. The repo intentionally
  ships as a single agent file + two installers + the docs that
  explain it.

### Security

- Cleared the broken `homepageUrl` in repo metadata.
- The transient `web/package-lock.json` carried a moderate `postcss`
  XSS advisory (GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) for a few minutes; resolved when
  the landing page was removed. The shipping agent has no JS/CSS deps.

### Locked-in design principles

- **Weekly cadence is the product.** Window is always 7 days
  (or "since my last update" when continuing). No sprint / month /
  arbitrary-date mode — that would dilute the brand.
- **Tool-light, not tool-free.** Only `ask_user` and read-only `gh`
  are used. No writes, no other shell, no third-party APIs.
- **Conversational refinement over options.** Users iterate in plain
  English (*"more casual"*, *"switch audience to team"*,
  *"open it as an issue in `myorg/updates`"*) rather than CLI flags.
- **No invention.** The agent never adds work the user didn't mention
  or that GitHub didn't surface.
