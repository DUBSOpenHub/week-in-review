## ✨ Why you'll use it

| 🧠 You write | 🤖 You get back |
|---|---|
| Half-sentence brain dump | A polished status update |
| 30 seconds of typing | 0 seconds of writing |
| Notes only you understand | Markdown your team can ship from |

- 📌 **GitHub-issue-ready by default** — `##` headings render, `- [x]` becomes clickable checkboxes your team can tick off as work ships
- 🪶 **Tiny footprint** — one agent file, one installer, no servers, no config, no API keys
- 🪄 **No repo required** — runs from any GitHub Copilot CLI session, anywhere
- 🔁 **Conversational refinement** — ask for "more casual", "punchier", or "open it as an issue in `myorg/updates`"

## ⚡ Install

Three lines. No config. No keys.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/week-in-review.git
cd week-in-review && ./install.sh
# then in any Copilot CLI session: @week-in-review
```

Or, from inside a Copilot CLI session: `/agents add DUBSOpenHub/week-in-review`

**Requirements:** GitHub Copilot CLI · active [Copilot subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot) · macOS, Linux, or WSL.
**Privacy:** Your notes stay in your Copilot session. No telemetry, no analytics, nothing sent anywhere this agent doesn't already use.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Use it

From any GitHub Copilot CLI session — **no repo required**:

```
@week-in-review

ran the design review, fixed two flaky tests, finished the Q3 plan draft,
1:1s with three reports, prepping for the all-hands on Friday
```

You'll get a polished, issue-ready update back. Then:

- **Paste it** into a GitHub issue, Slack, or email
- **Ask for tweaks** — "make it more casual", "more formal", "punchier"
- **Have it filed** — "open this as an issue in `myorg/team-updates`"

## 🏗️ Built with the GitHub Copilot app

This whole project — agent prompt, installer, README, repo structure — was built in **conversation** inside the [GitHub Copilot app](https://github.com/features/copilot):

1. Started with a one-line idea: *"turn my messy weekly notes into a polished update"*
2. Iterated on the agent's output format live (Slack-style → GitHub-issue-style)
3. Asked Copilot to scaffold this repo using a sibling project ([terminal-stampede](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/terminal-stampede)) as a template
4. Shipped

No frameworks, no boilerplate generators, no setup. Just chat → refine → ship.

If you want to remix this agent for your own team — change the sections, the tone, the labels — open `agents/week-in-review.agent.md` in the Copilot app and ask it to make the changes. That's how it was built; that's the cleanest way to evolve it.
